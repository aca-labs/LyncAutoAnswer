Lync 2013 Auto Answer
=============================
A simple tray application that turns on Lync 2013 auto-answer and automatically starts video and full-screen mode. Ideal for conference rooms or hands-off remote kiosk units.

This is a fork of [Scott Hanselmans auto-answer](https://github.com/shanselman/LyncAutoAnswer), which has quite a few unhandled edge cases that are corrected in this version.

Features:
* Auto-answers video calls
* Switches to full-screen mode after answering the call
* Continues to work even after a Lync restart
* Answers video for existing conversations (IM/Audio/etc)
* Widowless tray application

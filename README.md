Lync Super Simple Auto Answer for Lync 2013
=============================
A simple tray application that turns on Lync 2013 auto-answer and automatically starts video and full-screen mode. Ideal for conference rooms or hands-off remote conferencing units.

This is a fork of [Scott Hanselmans auto-answer](https://github.com/shanselman/LyncAutoAnswer), which has quite a few unhandled edge cases that are corrected in this version.
